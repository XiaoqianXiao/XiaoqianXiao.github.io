abstract: 'OBJECTIVE: New antidepressant treatments are needed that are effective,
  rapid acting, safe, and tolerable. Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is
  a noninvasive brain stimulation treatment that has been approved by the U.S. Food
  and Drug Administration for treatment-resistant depression. Recent methodological
  advances suggest that the current iTBS protocol might be improved through 1) treating
  patients with multiple sessions per day at optimally spaced intervals, 2) applying
  a higher overall pulse dose of stimulation, and 3) precision targeting of the left
  dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)
  circuit. The authors examined the feasibility, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy
  of Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT), an accelerated,
  high-dose resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI)-guided iTBS protocol
  for treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Twenty-two participants with treatment-resistant
  depression received open-label SAINT. fcMRI was used to individually target the
  region of the left DLPFC most anticorrelated with sgACC in each participant. Fifty
  iTBS sessions (1,800 pulses per session, 50-minute intersession interval) were delivered
  as 10 daily sessions over 5 consecutive days at 90% resting motor threshold (adjusted
  for cortical depth). Neuropsychological testing was conducted before and after SAINT.
  RESULTS: One participant withdrew, leaving a sample size of 21. Nineteen of 21 participants
  (90.5%) met remission criteria (defined as a score textless11 on the Montgomery-Ã…sberg
  Depression Rating Scale). In the intent-to-treat analysis, 19 of 22 participants
  (86.4%) met remission criteria. Neuropsychological testing demonstrated no negative
  cognitive side effects. CONCLUSIONS: SAINT, an accelerated, high-dose, iTBS protocol
  with fcMRI-guided targeting, was well tolerated and safe. Double-blinded sham-controlled
  trials are needed to confirm the remission rate observed in this initial study.'
