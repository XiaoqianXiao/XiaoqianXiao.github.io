abstract: Although human memories seem unique to each individual, they are shared
  to a great extent across individuals. Previous studies have examined, separately,
  subject-specific and cross-subject shared representations during memory encoding
  and retrieval, but how shared memories are formed from individually encoded representations
  is not clearly understood. Using a unique fMRI design involving memory encoding
  and retrieval, and representational similarity analysis to link representations
  from different individuals, brain regions, and processing stages, the current study
  revealed that distributed brain regions showed both subject-specific and shared
  neural representations during both memory encoding and retrieval. Furthermore, different
  brain regions showed stage-specific representational strength, with the visual cortex
  showing greater unique and shared representations during encoding, whereas the left
  angular gyrus showing greater unique and shared representations during retrieval.
  The neural representations during encoding were transformed during retrieval, as
  shown by smaller cross-subject encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) than cross-subject
  similarity either during encoding or during retrieval. This cross-subject and cross-stage
  similarity was found both within and across regions, with strong pattern similarity
  between the encoded representation in VVC and the retrieved representation in the
  angular gyrus. Simulation analysis further suggested that these patterns could be
  achieved by incorporating stage-specific representational strength, and cross-region
  reinstatement from encoding to retrieval, but not by a common transformation from
  encoding to retrieval across subjects. Together, our results shed light on how memory
  representations are encoded and transformed to maintain individual characteristics
  and at the same time to create shared representations to facilitate interpersonal
  communication.
