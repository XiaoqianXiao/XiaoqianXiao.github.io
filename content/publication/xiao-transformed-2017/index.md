abstract: Contemporary models of episodic memory posit that remembering involves the
  reenactment of encoding processes. Although encoding-retrieval similarity has been
  consistently reported and linked to memory success, the nature of neural pattern
  reinstatement is poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI on human subjects,
  our results obtained clear evidence for item-specific pattern reinstatement in the
  frontoparietal cortex, even when the encoding-retrieval pairs shared no perceptual
  similarity. No item-specific pattern reinstatement was found in the ventral visual
  cortex. Importantly, the brain regions and voxels carrying item-specific representation
  differed significantly between encoding and retrieval, and the item specificity
  for encoding-retrieval similarity was smaller than that for encoding or retrieval,
  suggesting different nature of representations between encoding and retrieval. Moreover,
  cross-region representational similarity analysis suggests that the encoded representation
  in the ventral visual cortex was reinstated in the frontoparietal cortex during
  retrieval. Together, these results suggest that, in addition to reinstatement of
  the originally encoded pattern in the brain regions that perform encoding processes,
  retrieval may also involve the reinstatement of a transformed representation of
  the encoded information. These results emphasize the constructive nature of memory
  retrieval that helps to serve important adaptive functions.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
  Episodic memory enables humans to vividly reexperience past events, yet how this
  is achieved at the neural level is barely understood. A long-standing hypothesis
  posits that memory retrieval involves the faithful reinstatement of encoding-related
  activity. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the neural representations during
  encoding and retrieval. We found strong pattern reinstatement in the frontoparietal
  cortex, but not in the ventral visual cortex, that represents visual details. Critically,
  even within the same brain regions, the nature of representation during retrieval
  was qualitatively different from that during encoding. These results suggest that
  memory retrieval is not a faithful replay of past event but rather involves additional
  constructive processes to serve adaptive functions.
