abstract: Mental and neural representations of words are at the core of understanding
  the cognitive and neural mechanisms of reading. Despite extensive studies, the nature
  of visual word representation remains highly controversial due to methodological
  limitations. In particular, it is unclear whether the fusiform cortex contains only
  abstract orthographic representation, or represents both lower and higher level
  orthography as well as phonology. Using representational similarity analysis, we
  integrated behavioral ratings, computational models of reading and visual object
  recognition, and neuroimaging data to examine the nature of visual word representations
  in the fusiform cortex. Our results provided clear evidence that the middle and
  anterior fusiform represented both phonological and orthographic information. Whereas
  lower level orthographic information was represented at every stage of the ventral
  visual stream, abstract orthographic information was increasingly represented along
  the posterior-to-anterior axis. Furthermore, the left and right hemispheres were
  tuned to high- and low-frequency orthographic information, respectively. These results
  help to resolve the long-standing debates regarding the role of the fusiform in
  reading, and have significant implications for the development of psychological,
  neural, and computational theories of reading.
