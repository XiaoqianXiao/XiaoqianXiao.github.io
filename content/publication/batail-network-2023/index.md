abstract: 'Here, we investigated the brain functional connectivity (FC) changes following
  a novel accelerated theta burst stimulation protocol known as Stanford Neuromodulation
  Therapy (SNT) which demonstrated significant antidepressant efficacy in treatment-resistant
  depression (TRD). In a sample of 24 patients (12 active and 12 sham), active stimulation
  was associated with significant pre- and post-treatment modulation of three FC pairs,
  involving the default mode network (DMN), amygdala, salience network (SN) and striatum.
  The most robust finding was the SNT effect on amygdala-DMN FC (group*time interaction
  F(1,22) = 14.89, p textless 0.001). This FC change correlated with improvement in
  depressive symptoms (rho (Spearman) = -0.45, df = 22, p = 0.026). The post-treatment
  FC pattern showed a change in the direction of the healthy control group and was
  sustained at the one-month follow-up. These results are consistent with amygdala-DMN
  connectivity dysfunction as an underlying mechanism of TRD and bring us closer to
  the goal of developing imaging biomarkers for TMS treatment optimization.Trial registration:
  ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03068715.'
