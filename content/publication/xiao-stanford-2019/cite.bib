In turn, efforts to elucidate mechanisms have been challenging due to disease heterogeneity and limited effectiveness of treatments, which require weeks-to-months to induce remission. We recently developed a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation that induces remission in 90% of individuals with severe, treatment resistant MDD in 1-5 days (SAINT). This provides a new tool to begin exploring the network-level mechanisms of MDD remission.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessh3\textgreaterObjective\textless/h3\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterDetermine the functional connectivity (fc) changes that occur with SAINT in brain regions associated with emotion regulation.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessh3\textgreaterMethods\textless/h3\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterResting-state fMRI scans were performed just prior to (baseline), and following, open-label SAINT in 18 participants with severe, treatment-resistant MDD. Fc was determined between regions of interest (ROIs) defined a priori with well-described roles in emotion regulation.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessh3\textgreaterResults\textless/h3\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterFollowing SAINT treatment fc was significantly decreased between the following ROI pairs: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-striatum, DLPFC-amygdala, default mode network (DMN)-subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC), DMN-amygdala, DMN-striatum, amygdala-striatum, and between amygdala subregions. Greater clinical improvements were associated with larger decreases in fc between DLPFC-amygdala and DLPFC-insula. Greater clinical improvements were associated with smaller decreases in fc between sgACC-DMN. Significant increases and decreases in fc between insula-amygdala were observed depending on the subregions. Greater clinical improvements were associated with lower baseline fc between DMN-DLPFC, DMN-striatum, and DMN-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex.\textless/p\textgreater\textlessh3\textgreaterConclusion\textless/h3\textgreater \textlessp\textgreaterSAINT-induced remission from depression is associated with fc changes that suggest improved regulation of emotion. Although preliminary, this leads us to hypothesize that interventions that augment top-down regulation of emotion may be effective depression treatments.\textless/p\textgreater},
