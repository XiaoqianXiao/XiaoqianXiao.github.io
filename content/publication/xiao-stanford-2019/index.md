  textlessptextgreaterMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is prevalent and debilitating,
  and development of improved treatments is limited in part by insufficient understanding
  of the mechanism of disease remission. In turn, efforts to elucidate mechanisms
  have been challenging due to disease heterogeneity and limited effectiveness of
  treatments, which require weeks-to-months to induce remission. We recently developed
  a form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation that induces remission in
  90% of individuals with severe, treatment resistant MDD in 1-5 days (SAINT). This
  provides a new tool to begin exploring the network-level mechanisms of MDD remission.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterObjectivetextless/h3textgreater

  textlessptextgreaterResting-state fMRI scans were performed just prior to (baseline),
  and following, open-label SAINT in 18 participants with severe, treatment-resistant
  MDD. Fc was determined between regions of interest (ROIs) defined a priori with
  well-described roles in emotion regulation.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterResultstextless/h3textgreater
  textlessptextgreaterFollowing SAINT treatment fc was significantly decreased between
  the following ROI pairs: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-striatum, DLPFC-amygdala,
  default mode network (DMN)-subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC), DMN-amygdala, DMN-striatum,
  amygdala-striatum, and between amygdala subregions. Greater clinical improvements
  were associated with larger decreases in fc between DLPFC-amygdala and DLPFC-insula.
  Greater clinical improvements were associated with smaller decreases in fc between
  sgACC-DMN. Significant increases and decreases in fc between insula-amygdala were
  observed depending on the subregions. Greater clinical improvements were associated
  with lower baseline fc between DMN-DLPFC, DMN-striatum, and DMN-ventrolateral prefrontal
  cortex.textless/ptextgreatertextlessh3textgreaterConclusiontextless/h3textgreater
  textlessptextgreaterSAINT-induced remission from depression is associated with fc
  changes that suggest improved regulation of emotion. Although preliminary, this
  leads us to hypothesize that interventions that augment top-down regulation of emotion
  may be effective depression treatments.textless/ptextgreater'
