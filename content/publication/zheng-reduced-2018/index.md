abstract: Emerging studies have emphasized the importance of the fidelity of cortical
  representation in forming enduring episodic memory. No study, however, has examined
  whether there are age-related reductions in representation fidelity that can explain
  memory declines in normal aging. Using functional MRI and multivariate pattern analysis,
  we found that older adults showed reduced representation fidelity in the visual
  cortex, which accounted for their decreased memory performance even after controlling
  for the contribution of reduced activation level. This reduced fidelity was specifically
  due to older adults' poorer item-specific representation, not due to their lower
  activation level and variance, greater variability in neuro-vascular coupling, or
  decreased selectivity of categorical representation (i.e., dedifferentiation). Older
  adults also showed an enhanced subsequent memory effect in the prefrontal cortex
  based on activation level, and their prefrontal activation was associated with greater
  fidelity of representation in the visual cortex and better memory performance. The
  fidelity of cortical representation thus may serve as a promising neural index for
  better mechanistic understanding of the memory declines and its compensation in
  normal aging.
