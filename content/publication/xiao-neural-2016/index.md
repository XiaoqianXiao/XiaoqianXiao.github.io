abstract: It has been consistently shown that words representing living things are
  better remembered than words representing nonliving things, yet the underlying cognitive
  and neural mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. The present study used both
  univariate and multivariate pattern analyses to examine the hypotheses that living
  words are better remembered because (1) they draw more attention and/or (2) they
  share more overlapping semantic features. Subjects were asked to study a list of
  living and nonliving words during a semantic judgment task. An unexpected recognition
  test was administered 30Â min later. We found that subjects recognized significantly
  more living words than nonliving words. Results supported the overlapping semantic
  feature hypothesis by showing that (a) semantic ratings showed greater semantic
  similarity for living words than for nonliving words, (b) there was also significantly
  greater neural global pattern similarity (nGPS) for living words than for nonliving
  words in the posterior portion of left parahippocampus (LpPHG), (c) the nGPS in
  the LpPHG reflected the rated semantic similarity, and also mediated the memory
  differences between two semantic categories, and (d) greater univariate activation
  was found for living words than for nonliving words in the left hippocampus (LHIP),
  which mediated the better memory performance for living words and might reflect
  greater semantic context binding. In contrast, although living words were processed
  faster and elicited a stronger activity in the dorsal attention network, these differences
  did not mediate the animacy effect in memory. Taken together, our results provide
  strong support to the overlapping semantic features hypothesis, and emphasize the
  important role of semantic organization in episodic memory encoding.
