abstract: Although behavioral studies have consistently reported the spacing effect
  in learning, its cognitive and neural mechanisms are still not clearly elucidated.
  According to the storage/retrieval strength framework proposed by Bjork (1999; Bjork
  & Bjork, 1992), which was built on the study-phase retrieval hypothesis and the
  deficient processing hypothesis, the spacing effect is achieved by reducing memomtary
  retrieval strength during subsequent repetitions and thus enhancing storage strength.
  The present study tested this hypothesis with parallel fMRI and EEG. Participants
  were asked to study 180 words that were repeated three times, with half of the words
  having an inter-repetition-lag of 1-3 words (i.e., massed learning) and the other
  half an inter-repetition-lag of 25-35 words (i.e., spaced learning). An unexpected
  recognition test was administered 24Â h after learning. Consistent with Bjork's hypothesis,
  the EEG data suggested that spaced learning was associated with weaker retrieval
  strength, as indicated by a reduced familiarity effect in frontal N400. Meanwhile,
  spaced learning effectively enhanced the encoding process and thus led to stronger
  storage strength, as indicated by greater fMRI responses during learning in brain
  regions whose activities were associated with subsequent memory. Interestingly,
  no direct association was found between repetition priming and episodic memory.
  These results furthered our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the
  spacing effect.
